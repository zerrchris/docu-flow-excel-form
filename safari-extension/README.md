# DocuFlow Safari Extension

A Safari Web Extension that adds runsheet functionality to any webpage, allowing users to capture documents and data while browsing in Safari on macOS and iOS.

## Features

- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Same functionality as Firefox extension, optimized for Safari
- **Bottom Panel**: Persistent runsheet interface at the bottom of every webpage
- **Screen Capture**: Capture specific areas of any webpage (with Safari limitations)
- **Text Selection**: Add selected text from any page to your runsheet
- **Data Sync**: Sync captured data with the main DocuFlow web application
- **iOS Support**: Works on both macOS Safari and iOS Safari

## Safari-Specific Differences

### Screen Capture Limitations
- Safari has more restrictive screen capture APIs
- Uses `tabs.captureVisibleTab()` with fallback messaging
- May prompt users to use the main web app for full capture functionality

### Distribution Requirements
- **Must be distributed through Mac App Store**
- **Cannot be manually installed like Firefox extensions**
- Requires Apple Developer account for submission

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- macOS with Xcode installed
- Apple Developer account (for App Store submission)
- Safari 14+ for testing

### Xcode Project Setup

1. **Create Xcode Project**:
   ```bash
   # In Xcode, create new project
   # Choose "App" template
   # Enable "Safari Extension" capability
   ```

2. **Configure Extension**:
   - Set bundle identifier: `com.docuflow.safari-extension`
   - Add Safari Extension target to your app
   - Copy extension files to the Safari Extension target

3. **Update Info.plist**:
   ```xml
   <key>NSExtension</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSExtensionPointIdentifier</key>
       <string>com.apple.Safari.extension</string>
       <key>NSExtensionMainStoryboard</key>
       <string>Main</string>
   </dict>
   ```

## Usage Instructions

### For End Users
1. Download "DocuFlow" app from Mac App Store
2. Install and launch the app
3. Go to Safari â†’ Preferences â†’ Extensions
4. Enable "DocuFlow Runsheet Assistant"
5. Visit any webpage to see the DocuFlow panel

## Authentication Setup

The extension requires authentication with the main DocuFlow web application:

1. **Shared Session**: When logged into DocuFlow, the extension automatically inherits authentication
2. **Manual Auth**: Use the popup to manually authenticate if needed
3. **Token Storage**: Auth tokens stored securely in Safari's extension storage

## Privacy and Security

- Authentication required for web app sync
- Complies with Apple's privacy guidelines
- No data collection without user consent

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Screen capture not working**: Safari has restrictions, use main web app
- **Sync failing**: Check authentication in popup
- **Panel not appearing**: Refresh page and check extension is enabled

### Debug Mode
- Enable Safari Developer tools
- Check extension console for errors
- Verify permissions in Safari preferences

## Development Notes

### Cross-Browser Compatibility
- Shares core functionality with Firefox extension
- Uses WebExtensions API standard
- Platform-specific optimizations for Safari

### Future Enhancements
- iOS-specific gesture support
- Enhanced mobile Safari integration
- Advanced capture techniques within Safari limitations
